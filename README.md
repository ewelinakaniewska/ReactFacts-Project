# ReactFacts-Project
Simple static web app showing facts about React.js.

This is a basic web application built using React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It is my first project with React and was created as a learning exercise to understand component-based architecture and utility-first styling with Tailwind. The project includes a simple layout and demonstrates fundamental frontend development practices.
